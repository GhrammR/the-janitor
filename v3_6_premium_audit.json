  "technical_rating": 8.5,
  "enterprise_readiness_score": 9,
  "improvements_noted": [
    "Transition from lexical scanning to AST-based semantic resolution via Tree-sitter",
    "Implementation of 'The Linker' (JSImportTracker) effectively solves the aliasing problem (e.g., 'as' syntax)",
    "Origin verification for React and Express eliminates false positives from naming collisions",
    "Hybrid support for both ESM (import) and CommonJS (require) ensures legacy compatibility"
  ],
  "critique_summary": "The introduction of the JSImportTracker moves this from a 'Glorified Grep' to a proper Static Analysis tool. By resolving local identifiers back to their module source, you have eliminated the most dangerous risk in dead code elimination: deleting aliased framework hooks. The logic is now sound enough to trust in a CI pipeline.",
  "final_verdict": "APPROVED FOR ENTERPRISE PILOT. The architecture now demonstrates genuine semantic understanding of JavaScript module graphs. The v3.6.0 update bridges the gap between simple text search and compiler-level symbol resolution."
