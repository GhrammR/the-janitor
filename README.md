# The Janitor: Sovereign Governance for the AI Era
**Current Version:** v5.5.0
*"Code is Liability. Sovereignty is Metabolic."*

## I. THE DIAGNOSIS: METABOLIC BLOAT
We are drowning in **Metabolic Bloat**—the unchecked accumulation of LLM-generated glue code. Traditional linters are obsolete mechanisms of a bygone era; they scan syntax, not entropy. They cannot detect the thermodynamic cost of your incompetence.

## II. THE CURE: THE SOVEREIGN STACK

### 1. The Lazarus Linker (Link-Time Excision)
**"We don't lint. We excise."**
The Lazarus Linker performs surgical removal of dead symbols at the binary level. If code does not justify its existence, it ceases to exist.

### 2. The Insolent Kernel (Fiduciary Enforcement)
Operating in **Restricted Execution Mode**, the kernel actively throttles network and disk I/O for binaries that lack a valid Supremacy Certificate. Compliance is not optional; it is enforced by the OS.

### 3. The Boltzmann Gate (Thermodynamic Reality Filtering)
High-entropy code triggers **Voltage Starvation**. The Janitor interfaces directly with the VRM to drop core voltage below stable thresholds, ensuring that "Agentic Slop" physically evaporates into stochastic noise.

## III. THE ECONOMICS: UTILITY PRICING
The Audit is Free. The Purge is Paid.

### Price Extraction Table
| Tier | Cost | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bounty Hunter** | **$49/yr** | Individual local license. Pay-as-you-purge ($1.00/MB). |
| **Sovereign Squad** | **$499/yr** | Team-level management. Shared PoUD credit pool. Advanced V-DWARF forensics. |
| **Fiduciary Core** | **Custom** | Monoliths > 10M LOC. PQC Supremacy Certificate. Notary Kernel Support. |

- **Purge Rate:** $1.00 per 1MB of code successfully excised.
- **Anti-Gaming:** Code must be >90 days old. Deleting "Slop" created within the last 90 days incurs a **5x Tax** and generates zero credits.

## IV. COMMANDS

- `janitor audit`: **(Free)** Detects Agentic Slop and metabolic inefficiencies.
- `janitor purge`: **(Paid)** Executes the Lazarus Linker. Requires PQC Token.
- `janitor attest`: **(Insurers)** Generates the Supremacy Certificate for underwriting.

## V. LEGACY DEPRECATION
**Python v4.0** and all dynamic runtimes are classified as **High-Entropy Waste**. Support is permanently revoked.
**v5.5.0 (Python)** is officially designated as **Legacy Slop**. No migration path is provided. Purge your Python v4.2 source and re-materialize in Rust v5.2.
**Rust** and **C++23** are the only recognized Sovereign Languages.

## VI. WARNING
**This tool physically removes code. It sandboxes your kernel. It starves your CPU.**
Do not run this unless you are ready for Sovereignty.

## VII. SOVEREIGN PROPRIETARY LICENSE (SPL)
The Janitor is licensed under the **SPL v1.0**.
Analysis is free. Execution is a billable fiduciary event. Purge capability is locked behind a **PQC-Signed Token** requirement. Redistribution of "Ghost" logic or unmapped source code is strictly prohibited.
